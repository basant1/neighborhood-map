### by Basant Singh

## What it does

Neighborhood map is a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. It includes map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. This application uses Google Maps API to create the map and a third-party API called FourSquare to add a link to provide more information about the places.
